The rules were:\r\n- no command line or console ( we are not here to learn linux.. )\r\n- run locally, with tools that are available online for free\r\n- basic javascript & html knowledge required\r\n- mostly copy-paste code ( use existing demos )\r\n\r\nThese were used and no animals were harmed:\r\n- MAMP server ( https://www.mamp.info/en/ )\r\n- snakes game and tutorial ( http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/html5-game-tutorial-make-a-snake-game-using-html5-canvas-jquery )\r\n- Glome API with demo apikey ( https://api.glome.me/simpleapi/ )\r\n- Any code/text editor ( I like: https://panic.com/coda/ )\r\n\r\n## What is Glome?\r\n\r\nGlome ( www.glome.me ) is an account management and personalisation platform. We offer a simple API and tools for businesses to serve their users/customers across multiple devices and earn their trust.
