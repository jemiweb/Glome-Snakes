# Glome-Snakes
A non-coder demo of the classic Snakes game linked to Glome for saving games and playing across multiple devices.

## Brief / task

I wanted to make a demo that uses the Glome API for non-developers. The rules were:
- no command line or console ( we are not here to learn linux.. )
- run locally, with tools that are available online for free
- basic javascript & html knowledge required
- mostly copy-paste code ( use existing demos )

These were used and no animals were harmed:
- MAMP server ( https://www.mamp.info/en/ )
- snakes game and tutorial ( http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/html5-game-tutorial-make-a-snake-game-using-html5-canvas-jquery )
- Glome API with demo apikey ( https://api.glome.me/simpleapi/ )
- Any code/text editor ( I like: https://panic.com/coda/ )


Enjoy, comment, upgrade, play, learn.
